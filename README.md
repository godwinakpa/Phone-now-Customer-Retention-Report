# Phone-now-Customer-Retention-Report
PwC Virtual Internship project 3

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we donâ€™t want to lose them
This analysis is timely to enable the retention department to get customers back 
in case of termination. 
Hitherto, the retention department get in touch after they have terminated the 
contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is 
at risk. 
This report is prepared for the management to know more about their customers: 
visualised clearly in a self-explanatory way.

- *Recommendations*
1) Increase tech support capacity for fibre optic customers.
2) Lower tech tickets per customer to half.
3) Increase sale of 1 and 2 year contracts.
4) Yearly increase of automatic payments (bank transfer & credit cards)
