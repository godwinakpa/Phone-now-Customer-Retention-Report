# Phone-now-Customer-Retention-Report
*PwC Virtual Internship project 3*

### Overview
Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: companies should 
endeavour not to lose them.
This analysis is timely to enable the retention department to get 
customers back in case of termination. 
Hitherto, the retention department get in touch after they 
(dissatisfied customers) have churned (terminated their contract), 
but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance those 
customers who are at risk. 

This report is prepared for the management to know more about their customers: 
visualised clearly in a self-explanatory way.


### Recommendations
With regards to this analysis, here are my recommendations:
1) Increase tech support capacity for fibre optic customers.
2) Lower tech tickets per customer to half.
3) Increase sale of 1 and 2 year contracts.
4) Yearly increase of automatic payments (bank transfer & credit cards)
